      disciplines, except Nordic combined.<br/> Canada finished with 11 gold medals and 29 overall (ranking 3rd in both categories). This was the most successful Canadian performance in terms of overall medals, surpassing the 26 won at the 2010

      <hr> An Oscar for Kobe Bryant
    </h1>
    <p>
      Joining Frances McDormand, Jordan Peele and Gary Oldman in accepting Academy Awards on Sunday night was someone more readily associated with other kinds of honors: Kobe Bryant. <br /> <br /> Bryant, who retired from the N.B.A. in 2016, was involved
      in turning a poem he wrote into a film, “Dear Basketball,” that won the prize for best animated short.<br /> <br /> The film depicts Bryant as a child dreaming of basketball glory and as an N.B.A. star. Bryant said the film was “about the emotional
      journey of having a dream, believing it’ll come true; it comes true, then the realization that you have to wake up from that dream and move on to another.” <br /> <br /> Bryant surrounded himself with first-rate teammates in creating the film, including
      John Williams, the five-time Oscar winning composer, and Glen Keane, a former Disney animator. <br /> <br />

      Bullfighting
    </h1>
    <p>
      With his tight trousers and boots, Luis Miguel Castrillon is dressed to kill as he prances, feints and pirouettes around a charging bull. The crowd applauds, but for animal rights campaigners in Colombia, the bullfighter is a cruel killer.<br/>      Applause swelled around Bogota's arena for the past month as Castrillon and other matadors taunted and dispatched bulls during the city's annual bullfighting festival.<br/> But animal rights activists, whose campaign is taking hold in a traditional
      bullfighting stronghold, point to the sparse attendances in the arena - well short of the 10,000 clamouring aficionados that once filled it for the month-long festival.<br/>
